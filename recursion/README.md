Recursion is, in computer science, a way to shortcut and solve problems. In fact, recursion is one of the central ideas of computer science.
1 Solving a problem by recursion means that the solution depends on the solutions of smaller instances of the same problem.2

The power of recursion evidently lies in the possibility of defining an infinite set of objects with a finite statement. 
Similarly, an infinite number of computational operations can be described by a finite recursive program, even if this program does not contain explicit repetitions. "3
Most programming languages support recursion by allowing a function to call itself from program text. Imperative languages define 
loop structures such as while and for that are used to perform repetitive tasks. Some functional programming languages do not define loop
 structures but enable recursion by calling code repeatedly. Computability theory has shown that these two types of languages are mathematically
 equivalent, i.e. they can solve the same types of problems, even though functional languages lack the typical while and for structures.
