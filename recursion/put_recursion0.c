/** wirte   function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void _puts_recursion(char *s);  
*/

in one only code

Here's the implementation of the _puts_recursion function in one line:



void _puts_recursion(char *s){(*s) ? (putchar(*s), _puts_recursion(s+1)) : putchar('\n');}

/**
This implementation uses a ternary operator to check if the current character is
 not null ((*s)). If it is not null, the function prints the current character
 using putchar(*s) and then recursively calls itself with the next character in 
the string (_puts_recursion(s+1)). If the current character is null, the function simply prints a newline character using putchar('\n').

Note that while this implementation is more concise, it may be less readable and harder to debug than the previous implementations we provided.*/
